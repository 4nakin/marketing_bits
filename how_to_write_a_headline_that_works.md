How to write a headline that works.
====================================

Writing a good headline is not *that* hard. There are many simple techniques that you 
can use to write it. The only issue you will face is writing a headline 
makes sense to the market you are selling to.

    The absolute truth about headlines.
    
    In order to write a headline that works, you must know your target market.
    The same way that in order to write a program that works, you must know
    the platform it will run in.
    
    You better not be reading this Marketing Bit hoping that I will give you the
    secret to writing awesome headlines without putting in the effort. You need
    to learn about your market. Who are they? What makes them (angry, happy, 
    sad)? Where do they live? What language they speak? Basically, learn as
    much as you can about your market. Every minute spent doing this will result
    in a better response (and more profits).
    
    
**Techniques.**

I will now show you the techniques I, and professional copywriters use 
to write headlines that *sell*.

Start your headline with one of the following words:

 - What
 - Who
 - Where
 - Why
 - How
 - When
 - The
 - A
 - New
 - Introducing
 - Free 
 - To
 - You
 - They
 - My
 - Announcing
 - Presenting
 - Would
 - Those
 
Ok, that's the basic list you can use to start. Realize that this is a general list.
You will find (through testing) that there are some words that will work specifically
well for a given market. For example, the word *actionable* works extremely well
within the software industry. Now, don't go and put the word actionable into
every software related ad you write. 

Allow me to write some examples for you.

How long should a headline be? As long as it needs to be in order to sell.
Some people say that a short headline is better, others the opposite.
In reality, it all boils down to whatever works best for you. Find out by testing.

**Random bits about headlines.**

- Grammar is not really important (unless you are selling to people who value grammar). YOU CAN USE ALL CAPS. And. you. can. also. use. weird. syntax. Whatever works!

- Test the same headline with different typefaces. Includes **bold**, *italics*, and underlined. Note: markdown does not have a way to underline words.
