Using keywords.
===============

One very useful technique to improve your copywriting (and search ranking) 
is to look up the most used SEO keywords for your particular product. 
The technique I use to find which keywords work is by 
searching for the product I plan to sell (or something like it). Then I 
click on the top 25 search results. After that, I copy/paste (or scrape) the content of
following html tags:

- title
- All h1.
- All h2.

You will also need to look at the paragraphs. Sometimes the most valuable
keywords are in them. Just read and copy/paste those that catch your attention.

With this data in my hands, I can then start writing headlines that include 
these keywords.

**An example**

    &lttitle&gtLearn how to write Ruby on Rails applications.&lt/title&gt
    
    &lth1&gtWrite Ruby on Rails applications with ease.&lt/h1&gt
    
    &lth2&gtThe MVC pattern in Rails.&lt/h2&gt
    
    &ltp&gtRuby on Rails is an MVC framework. It is desgined to get your 
    applications running with the least amount of development time.&lt/p&gt
    

In the example, the keywords are:

- Ruby
- Ruby on Rails
- Rails
- Learn Ruby on Rails
- Learn Rails
- Ruby on Rails applications
- Rails applications
- Rails MVC

Using those keywords and the basic list from the last chapter we can write
some new headlines.

####Exercise

Do a web search for your own product. Use as many keywords you can think of to 
search it. Click on the first 25 results for each keyword you search under.
Then complete the process outlined above. Write 2 headlines for each keyword.

Do an extra search on Twitter to find out what words are being tagged
for the same product type. Write 2 headlines with each trending keyword.
