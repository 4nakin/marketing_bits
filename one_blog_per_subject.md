One blog per subject.
====================

One of the key ingredients to online success are company blogs.
They are quite the versatile tool. A blog can be used as a customer support tool
by providing detailed documentation on a given subject. It may also be 
used to break out product news. Or even to interact with the community.

But a test to run is one blog per subject. Test a blog that only features 
product tutorials. Test a blog for product news. Test a blog for customer service.

Why test this?

If you have a product that has an above average learning curve (meaning that
people will need training) a separate blog will allow you to track what areas people
are having difficulty with. Its true that you can track this in a general
blog, but having it in a separate blog has shown[1] to provide one advantage.

    Blogs that cover one subject allow for greater information discovery
    by users.
    
Think about it. If you are a customer searching for answers. Do you want to 
search through a bunch of non-related information? Or do you want to search
through related information?

You might say this is what tags are for. Sure, they do work. But tags are for more
specific subjects. Mixing too much tags sometimes overwhelms people.

Do link to your other blogs in your sidebar. But test this. 

Another positive result is that you can run more specific tests with each blog.
You can test new potential product offerings, pricing, and regional availability.
Many things can be tested with better accuracy.

I know this is more work, and requires more time commitment plus all the overhead
of maintaining more code. But my results have proved positive most of the time.
Test it.
