Need versus want.
=================

Do people need to purchase a new car every year? No. Do they want to drive the latest model? Yes.
Why? The answer is fairly simple. People want the social status that a new car grants.
Beign able to afford a new car gives the impression of wealth (whether you have it or not).
Wealth is one of the key vanities of society. 

##Don't sell products that people need. 

Programmers and tech startups usually make one constant mistake. They build
products from the POV of market need. Every few days someone posts on Hacker News

Pay attention. What products do people pay for? What do they want?

####The iPod.

I love the way the history of the iPod. One of the key products of the last ten

of this.

Here we were, lugging around big bulky CD players that would skip and eat AA batteries like crazy.
And no one seemed to want to fix that. People did not want to carry CD players.
People wanted their music at all times. They needed CD players to get what they wanted.
Need > Want.

Suddenly, the iPod came out allowing people to forgo of CDs and carry around
*thousands* of songs in one compact package. Oh, and it had a rechargable battery.
People wanted the iPod (they still do).

The fact that it was packaged brilliantly was icing on the cake. That was Job's genius at work.
He understood what people wanted.
