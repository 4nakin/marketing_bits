The slippery slide.
====================

The slippery slide (term coined by Joe Sugarman (read his books)) is a simple concept. Imagine that your ad is a slide.
On top you can see your prospects waiting for their turn to slide down.
At the bottom, they either buy or not. Your job is make them slide
down as quickly as possible without harming them. The aim is to make the
slide very slippery. 

If the slide is not slippery, what happens? They don't slide down. Thus, they
never reach the buy or don't buy point. They may get stuck and just jump out
of the slide. We don't want that!

    The slippery slide:
    
    Prospects
    -
     |
      -
       |    ...The slide...
        -
         |
          -
           |
            The buying decision.

If people don't make it down the slippery slide, then they will not get a chance to 
buy your product. The aim for reading rhythm is to create this slippery slide in your copy.

Let me show you an example. One ad without a slippery slide, one ad with a slippery slide.

Was it hard to read that? Good. It was hard to *write*. But orange, there
is no way someone would write an ad like that!

LOL.

Just go to Hacker News and go to the landing page of almost every startup
mentioned there. Their copy is sometimes as bad as that one. Most of the
time its *worse*. I'm not talking abou two-man operations either. Some are
top YC startups. I won't mention names, but its just mind blowing.  

Ok, enough of that. I'm going to re-write the ad above.

*Whew!*

Ok. The difference is outstanding. Which one do you think people will read? Exactly.
The slippery slide in the second ad is very obvious. It starts with the headline. 

*7 out of 10 clients were able to better understand where their income was coming in. Our simple to use program makes it easy. Find out how.*

It instantly disqualifies anyone who is not a business owner. And business owners who don't have the problem $product_name aims to solve. It also set the pace for the ad. It starts out long, but finishes with a three word sentence.

Then the paragraphs use a simple short/long sentence pattern. You feel like stop and go traffic. But you never stop moving.
Your eyes keep reading down the page. Thats the point!

The subheadlines are also interesting. If you only read them, and don't read the actual copy, 
you can still see that I'm closing the sale. In the sub-headlines. This is specially important, because people are lazy.

But I will not tell you more about it. Print a copy and study it. See how it works. Reverse-engineer the ad.

    Warning: the ads above have not been tested. Do not replicate with hopes of either one working. 
    They were only written to teach you about the slippery slide.
