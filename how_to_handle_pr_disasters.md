How to handle PR disasters (for startups).
=============================================


I don't get why do small startups screw up PR disasters. Its a really simple
process, but sometimes their "apologies" end up being worse
than the original issue.

I've written a simple guide to help out those startups that want to avoid
such disaster.



##Understand the problem. What/why/how/who/when did you do wrong ?

Don't point fingers! Just find out what happened. Include all parties involved.

##Contact the people you hurt and try to make things right by fixing the issue. 

Key word is try, but do it genuinely. Some people cannot be pleased or demand 
too much in exchange. If that happens dont humiliate them publicly by stating
it. Let it *go*.



##Write a good press release in the form of a blog post. 

Title it: Our apology for $problem. In the press release include:

- We are sorry this happened.

- This is how we are fixing/going to fix it.

- If you have been wronged by this get in touch at $email.

- Thank everyone for their feedback.

##Publish a second press release as a blog post stating what you are doing to prevent $problem.

You need to overcome the wave of negative press with your own positive press. Push
back by writing blog posts, tweets, etc. Don't hide. Now its the time to stand up 
and show that you are, indeed, in charge of fixing what you broke.


####But wait, there's more!    
    
With the gained attention, you can choose to market a new product/service/special to show people 
you are focused on doing good busines. Call it the "We are sorry special pack" or whatever.
Showcase the issue, how you solved it, and include the special deal at the bottom.

Make sure to post it on every social media site out there so that people know you are taking care of your customers.

**NOTE:**

Don't do immediately after the issue arose. Wait at least a week!
This does not work for every PR disaster. YMMV. Consult your marketer.
