        <h1>You can build software.<br> But can you sell it?</h1>
        
       <p> I've spent half of my life learning how to build and sell stuff. Nowdays, I'm a software
engineer and marketing consultant. I build and help sell software. This gives
me very valuable knowledge that I'm now sharing with you.</p>

<p>That is why Marketing Bits exists. To share and showcase all the insight I've
gained over the years. Topics include (online and offline) marketing, sales, copywriting, public relations,
and more.</p>

<p>Marketing Bits are free to read online. In the near future, I will offer all
Marketing Bits plus ready-to-use marketing tools in digital formats, for you
to purchase and download. But you don't need to purchase anything if you read it
online.</p>

<h4>About me:</h4>
<p>
Full stack software engineer and marketer, with more than six years of professional experience.
Building and marketing all types of systems from e-commerce, to high-demand APIs, to
payment platforms. Also have experience marketing non-tech products and e-books.
