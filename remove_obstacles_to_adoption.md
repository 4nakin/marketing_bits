Remove obstacles to adoption.
=============================


I'm working in a high profile project in the mobile advertising market.
Everything was on schedule and moving at a good pace until I had 
to integrate with a third party. Now I'm at least two days behind due to the integration.

The issue: 

    I need to get in contact with an ad-serving API, and need an API key.
    The process to get the API key is to create an account and wait
    until it is approved.
    

This is some really bad sales design here. When the product is an API you want
to remove all the possible obstacles that lower adoption rates. Right now, this
company is sabotaging its success by making it hard for engineers to easily
integrate with their API.

As APIs grow in popularity, companies have to understand one thing:

    Anytime spent waiting for an API key is time not spent integrating with you.
    
    
####Do like Stripe.

Stripe is one of those companies that *gets it*. Their API documentation is spot on.
Full of code samples that are ready to use. But what really drives the adoption of Stripe
is the follwing  bit:

    Stripe has an open test account that anyone can use to integrate their product.
    
No need to wait for approvals. No time wasted. Just take your API key, their testing account data
and start integrating (with their sample code).

Stripe::Simple. Love it.

####Focus on simple processes.

You need to realize that processes that are too complicated make
people quit along the way. Meaning that only a percentage of the people
that are intested in your product ever manage to make it through your process.
    
Look at your processes. Run tests with real live users and make note of where
people have problems. Measure the time it takes for a new user to register or use
the product. 

This is a real problem these days. A lot of online businesses don't seem to understand 
that putting a *sign-up now!* button on the landing page is counter-productive.
Instead, have people use a test version of your product. Get them emotionally 
involved and invested before anything. 

####The offline equivalent.

Ever had a supermarket:

- Ask your name.
- Ask you to pick a password.
- Fill in your credit card details.

...before entering?
    
No, because supermarkets *know* that if they complicate the process people will
simply go and buy somewhere else. Its quite idiotic to do the same thing
with online products. You walk into the supermarket, get the things you need, and
*then* register with them (the checkout lane). Do you know why people wait in line
to buy their groceries? Because they already went through the trouble of putting
them inside the shopping cart. Even though they haven't payed, the products are already theirs.
The emotional investment is done before they have to take out their hard earned money to pay.

**But it wasn't always like that!**

Before supermarkets existed people got their groceries from smaller stores.
Back then, the store personnel (usually relatives of the owner) got the groceries
for you. The role of the client was a passive one. Even though these stores controlled the amount of theft (shrinkage) they had not
realized how many sales they were losing from people making impulse purchases. They even didn't know that children are a big factor on the grocery bill. 

Grocery stores did what a lot of startups do these days. They put an obstacle right at the start of the buying process. Not knowing
how many sales were being lost to it. The key words here are *buying process*. The way people buy is a process. Complicate it and less
people buy. Simplify it and people can iterate quickly over it and be done in no time.

Realize that this is similar to *Big O Notation*.

    The Big-O is the formal method of expressing the upper bound of an algorithm's running time. It's a measure of the longest amount
    of time it could possibly take for the algorithm to complete. [1]

By simplyfying your buying process you are technically reducing the amount of time it takes for someone to buy something from you.
The less time people waste on the buying process, the more time they can invest in buying from you.

####PS.

This does not apply to all businesses. Some benefit from *complicating* the process. Though these are generally in the
luxury category, and are a very small group.
