Objections and Exceptions.
==========================

Everytime you go to buy something, you have a couple of little things called objections.
These seemingly cute things are your worst nightmare when it comes to selling.
Think about it! What is the first thing you think about when considering a product?
The price, maybe? What if its too high? You object to the price, of course.
Think of objections like exceptions that run in the minds of prospects
when they are considering buying your product.

    Read it again because this is important!
    
    
     
    Objections are like exceptions that run in the minds of prospects 
    when they are considering buying your product.

Like exceptions in your program, you must handle them correctly. You simple cannot
ignore them. Face them. Challenge them. Make people think twice about their objections.
Hit them with everything you got. This is not the place to be civil. Failure to 
properly handle an objection will make you lose money. Picture many hundred dollars
bills flying away from your wallet for every objection you don't handle properly.


**How to deal with objections?**

Address them directly. Just don't go out and be too upfront about it. If your product has a higher price than the competition, then
by all means explain why. People will object to the higher price. So handle their objection!

    Example:
    
    Don't say:
    
        $product_name costs $50 more, because it has more features.
        
    Say:
        $product_name had more features than any other product in the $market.
        That is why the investment in $product_name is more
        inline with its quality. You get much more for what you purchase. Unlike
        $competing_product, $product_name features $foo, and $bar. The only 
        offering in the market with such qualities. Remember, you don't want 
        to buy the cheapest option. You want to make the best investment.
        

Mention the objections in your landing page and sales materials. Don't try and hide the facts. Face them 
directly. In fact, sometimes I tell companies to include them in their F.A.Q. section.

Wouldn't this turn people away? No. It won't. People who are interested in 
your product will want to address these very same issues. Why is it more expensive?
Why is it not available in Canada? Why do I have to pay so much for shipping?
Why does it come in one color?

Like a 7 year old child, clients just ask *Why*? Make sure to answer properly.
