Closing.
========

*Always Be Closing.*

How do you close? Many books have been written on the subject. One thing I've learned over the years is that closing is about
one thing, and one thing only: 

    Closing is about **pushing** people to buy.
    
    
You don't like pushing people to buy? Too bad! Your children will be very skinny.
To write a great close, you need to realize one thing:

    Any fear that you may have about selling boils down to one simple bit: rejection.
    Closing is about facing rejection in the eyes and telling it to bring it on.
    Do not fear rejection, because it is merely an automatic response from people.
    Almost everybody will reject your sales pitch the first time.
    It's OK!
    Don't go crying home to mom, yet.
    
    What you need to do is pitch them again. And again. And again. Until they give
    up and buy. Keep asking for the sale until the sale is made.
    
    A great close is more about attitude. If you are deaf to the word NO, but
    can hear a whisper of the word YES, then your closing rate will be profitable.
    
That is some boiler room talk right there. I know. But closing is easy. Just ask for the sale.

**How to write good closes.**

Closing on written ads is a bit tougher than in real life. This due to the 
fact that people cannot verbally or physically decline the offer. To write
a good closing argument you will need ask for the sale. Huh?

Read on.

I count 19 different closes right there.

Let's break it down.


    1. Now that you have realized how better off your life is with $product_name,
    why don't you try it out?
    
    You are telling the prospect your life will be better with $product_name. Buy it now.
    

    2. With the FREE 30 day-trial, you will be able
    to experience the amazing properties of $product_name.
    
    You are giving them the chance to use the product for 30 days. They are essentially buying it.
    Note: Trials are great because once people spend something with something they hardly ever
    want to give it back. The feeling of losing is too great. Plus some people are just afraid
    of speaking up. All of this works to your advantage.
    

    3. Still not convinced?
    
    Challenge the rejection. Close.
    
    4. $product_name is backed by a bullet-proof 30-day money back guarantee.
    
    Same as the free trial. In fact, they are the same thing worded differently.

    5. Try $product_name for a month.
    
    Go ahead. Try it. We are challenging you to try it out. Close by challenging.

    6. If you are not completely happy with your puchase. 
    
    This is an emotional close. People will be afraid of buying stupid things.
    Cater to their emotions and ease the fear. Close by making them feel secure.

    7. And I mean it.
    
    Honesty close. Some people just don't believe you. Being honest (or appearing to be so) will make them believers.

    8. Not a 100% satisfied.
    
    Another emotional close.
 
    9. Visit our website and request a full refund.
    
    Close by telling them how to get their money back. This is a brilliant way 
    to get people to buy expensive products. It also works great because you
    can re-close the sale on your website. Thus reducing the amount of refundsyou have to issue.
    Also allows for you to upsell other products. Its just brilliant overall.

    10. No questions asked.
    
    Another emotional close. People fear answering questions as to  why they are returning it.
    Letting them know in advance there are no questions to answer will put them in a buying mood.
    
    11. No secret charges.
    
    Close by letting them know you won't steal their money. Imporatant close to include everywhere possible.
    
    
    12. Order now.
    
    Ask for the sale directly.
    
    13. Don't waste this opportunity to change your life with $product_name.
    
    Close by making them think there is a scarcity issue around the product.

    14. www.web-address.com
    
    Including your web address is the most important closing technique to use.
    If people manage to go online and visit your page, then they definitely want
    to buy. 

    15. PS.
    
    The PS. close. This is your last chance to close the deal. Always include the offer here.
    Note: Some people just read the PS. 

    16. Order now and receive a second $product_name for 50% off.
    
    The math close. Most people can't do percentages based math. Its simpler
    to close on *percentage off* kind of deals than on buy-1-get-1-free types.
    They never realize they are spending more money on the purchase.

    17. That's 2 $product_names for the price of one and a half.
    
    The buy-1-get-the-other-at-half-price close. Same as above, jusr different wording.
    Aimed at people that do get math, but are bad with overall purchase amount.

    
    18. While supplies last. 
    
    Scarcity close.
    
    
    19. We accept Paypal.
    
    The Paypal close. Like it or not, a lot of people only use Paypal to buy online. If you
    don't include this on your close, then they might not bother buying. Very important. Do not leave out.
    


Remember, closing is about challenging their rejection, and pushing people to buy. Focus on why they are rejecting you (the objections), and close.
