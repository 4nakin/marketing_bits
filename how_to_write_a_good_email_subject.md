How to write a good email subject.
==================================


A good email marketing campaign starts with a good email subject. Like all
sales letters, email requires a good headline (the email subject) to grab 
the attention of your recipients. If your email campaign is not working
then the email subject is very likely to be the culprit.

You need to use a personal tone for emails. Why? Because email is personal. Its a one-to-one 
conversation between you and the recipient. Go to your inbox. Look at the subjects.
Which reads personal and which does not?

    Bad: 
    
    The information you requested.   
    

    Good: 
    
    I think this might help you save some time with $problem.
    
    Better:
    
    $name, I help people deal with $problem. Do you mind taking a quick look?
    
    

Sometimes the email subject is the email itself. I once ran a campaign that 
wa smade up of one line:

    If you need a software engineer give me a call at 787 901 9146. I'm available.

Results? Two contracts in the five figures. 

####Tips.

- Include your phone number in the subject.
- Include the name of the recipient.
- Do not be vague.
- Say where you are writing from (Hi, its orange from Marketing Bits...).

    
    
####Exercise

Write two (2) email subjects using the tips above.

    Example:
    
    Hey, its $name from $company. I thought you would like to check out our $product.
    
    I sell $product. Someone told me you might be in need of one. Contact me at $phone number
    if you need some help.
    

Having trouble geting started?

Write your full name 20 times. By the time you are done, you will want to 
continue writing.
