How to easily break into any market.
====================================

Every market out there, no matter how small it may be, has an online community.
These communities usually form around message boards. They have their own
culture and language. Members become friends and develop a very tight bond. That
relationship can be used to market under the radar. I don't mean spamming, but
easily selling to people who have their defenses down.

Message boards are their own little club. Everyone loves being part of a club.
It makes you feel special. Whenever you meet someone from that club you open
up your eyes and ears and pay special attention to them.

That is why the following technique (which I developed) works so well.

##The technique.

You might not be surprised to know that something so simple works so perfectly. 
It is about 90% effective when used, and has the best response rates I have ever seen. 
The technique centers around using the following sentence as your email message subject.

    Dropping by from $place.
    
Yes, that is it. But let's see why it works.

####Why it works.

Like I said above, people love to belong. They want to, and *have to*. Our genetics
dictate that no man is an island. We seek social contact like we seek food.
That is why we join in with people who share similar interests and create
long lasting bonds. The technique simply exploits that bond and makes
people turn off their defenses. We are trained to be very demanding from our emails. 
Never opening anything that seems *fishy*. 
But the subject line is not fishy (or at least wont be until this is published).
Its personal, friendly, and non-confrontional. Who would know that behind such
subject is a marketing campaign carefully engineered to get them to buy something?
No one. People never realize it. The best marketing goes unnoticed.

 
####How I use it.

I've used that very same line for a couple of years. It has gotten me access 
to a lot of places, a lot of work, and a lot of sales (for me and clients).

I usually write a very simple message to go with it. The purpose of the technique
is to create familiarity with me. To make the conversation as warm as possible
in the shortest time. That is why the message subject should also be short and focus on the recipient.

Example:

    Hi, I'm $name. I read what you wrote on $place about $subject. Very cool. 
    I love talking about $subject. Would you like to talk more about it?
    
Few people can resist that message. It strokes their ego in such a manner that
they simply cannot hit reply fast enough.

####How does such a message subject and body turn into sales?

Simple. The marketing plan behind it will propel the conversation into the offer
by mentioning it in a casual manner.

Example:

    Hey $name,
        That was so funny. My friend Jimmy is always doing that too. By the way,
        I started selling $product the other day, and I'd like to know your opinion.
        I'm not selling you anything. Just let me know if you like it. If you do
        want it (no pressure), I can get you a nice discount. Let me know.
        
####One simple warning.

Don't use it with a direct sales pitch as the message body. It will get you banned
from that community in no time.

**Note:**

This technique can be easily abused. Don't! 
By sharing it I'm not encouraging anyone to spam people. Use it responsibly.
