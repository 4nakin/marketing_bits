The call to action.
===================
    
One common mistake businesses make is to forget to include a call to action. I see this constantly
in advertisements/landing pages written by programmerr and startups. They seem to think that their ad
is so logically written that the prospect will immediately understand what to do next.
I'm sorry, but people don't have time to figure out what comes next. Plus, they are too 
lazy to do so. Don't let the success of your ad be on the hands of the lazy. Tell
them what to do. Give them, in fact, provide them the most clear set of instructions
know to man. If you need to enumarate them, by all means do so. This is not the 
place to be lazy.

**How to write a good call to action.**

- Break down the buying process into steps. The focus is to make absolutely clear what the steps are.
- Remind them why they have to own your $product. 
- Provide any technical details they may need to know. Do they need to visit a website? Which one? Which credit card can they use?
- If you offer services in multiple languages, now is the time to do so.

Here is a basic example:

    To order $product_name:
    Go to www.website_address.com and click on the green button that says ORDER.
    Use your VISA, Master Card, or American Express Card. You may also use Paypal.
    Click on the orange button that says CHECKOUT.
    Remember: $Product name will help you with $problem in 30 days.
