Learn Real-World <u>Actionable</u> Marketing Know-How.
============================================

I've spent half of my life learning how to sell stuff. Nowdays, I'm a software
engineer and marketing consultant. I build and help sell software. This gives
me very valuable knowledge that I'm now sharing with you.

That is why Marketing Bits exists. To share and showcase all the insight I've
gained over the years. Topics include (online and offline) marketing, sales, copywriting, public relations,
and more.

Marketing Bits are free to read online. In the near future, I will offer all
Marketing Bits plus ready-to-use marketing tools in digital formats, for you
to purchase and download. But you don't need to purchase anything if you read it
online.

About me:

Full stack software engineer and marketer, with more than six years of professional experience.
Building and marketing all types of systems from e-commerce, to high-demand APIs, to
payment platforms. Also have experience marketing non-tech products and e-books.
