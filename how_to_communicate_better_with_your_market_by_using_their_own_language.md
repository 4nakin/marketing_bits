How to communicate better with your market by using their own language.
=======================================================================

Every market has its own jargon. Each member of that market (or group) will
recognize an outsider by their lack of market-specific jargon. Whenever you 
plan to sell to a market you must know the majority of the jargon used by its
members.

A great example I use is the buzzword "Full-Stack". What does it mean? It usually
means a software engineer/developer/programmer who know how to work with (read:setup and maintain) servers.
If you are a newcomer to the industry that word will seem alien. It is used
by individuals in the market to label or brand themselves under a specific definition.

The importance of this is the following. People use that jargon to describe
the problems they face. They also use to describe their ideal solution. When
some corporate suit is talking about technical synergy for the support department
all he/she means is that they are reducing the amont of IT staff and firing you.
If you knew the jargon you could reply with: 

"I have been providing feedback positive solutions to my upteam for
quite some time. My ROI value in the team is definitely business grade.
I suggest that people with less project traction get included in the synergy 
exercise and not me."

Meaning that you want them to not fire you because you get stuff done. (That was
hard to type.)

Ok, to summarize:

    You must learn the language your market uses 
    to describe the problems they face, and their ideal solution.
    
    By speaking in the same manner your market does, you can get them
    to read your ad with less effort. The more people read your ad, the more
    sales you can potentially make.
    
Read that again. When you speak in the same manner the market does, you can get them
to identify with it. That will get them to read it. Remember that the number one rule
of getting sales through written sales ads (and landing pages) is:

    Do whatever it takes for people to read it. 
    Without sorting to outrageous options (unless you sell outrageous products).
 

##Exercise
 
Visit the online communities your prospects visit. Read their content. Study
the advertisements in their discussion forums, blogs and or other type of content platform.
Write down the words you recognize as important. Research their meaning and save your findings.
Include them in your landing page and test their effectiveness.
